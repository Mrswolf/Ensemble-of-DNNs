# Transfer Learning of an Ensemble of DNNs for SSVEP BCI Spellers without User-Specific Training
This is the official repository for the paper [1] titled "An Ensemble of DNNs for SSVEP BCI Spellers without User-Specific Training". This repository allows you to train the ensemble of DNNs and classify the SSVEP signal using the most similar $k$ many DNNs as explained in the paper.

# Preparation
The Benchmark dataset [2] and BETA dataset [3] must be downloaded. The link for the both datasets: http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.
